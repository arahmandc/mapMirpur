Nowadays Mirpur is the most important area in Dhaka city. There are many head offices of government departments, refreshing zones, zoo, small industri, an International Cricket stadium, slums, and low income communities  growing up in Mirpur area. As a result the normal ecosystem is broken down. Lot of issues are created. It is natural in the urbanization process.
